## Overview

This project allows a user to load the included index.html and play through a card matching game within their browser of choice. Clicking cards will cause them to flip over. The goal of the game is for the player to match all 16 cards, for a total of 8 unique matches, in as few moves as possible. Every 10 moves the player will lose a star, down to a minimum of 1. At any point in time the player can utilize the reset button on the top right of the board to immediately reset the board.
